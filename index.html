				<p align="left">When I saw the trailer for The Foreigner I thought it was going to be 2 hours
				of Jackie Chan beating the crap out of people. In reality the film isn't really about Jackie going on
				a rampage while looking fo answers. Its really about Pierce Brosnan a 'former' IRA member turned politican
				trying to make political moves while this rightfully so, madman Jackie looms over him. The plot wasn't too
				convulted like political dramas tend to be. It was pretty cool to see Jackie fighting a bit dirty, smashing people
				through tables and cracking bottles over heads. The film was very chatty though and after the conflict was resolved
				it dragged for a bit. I'd suggest catching this one on tv if you like. But if you were looking for pure action
				you're better of watching a montage of the fights on youtube.
