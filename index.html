					<p class = "post-text">Justice League is a solid superhero movie. You get to see some cool fight scenes, hear some jokes although 
					some fall flat (greeting a Russian family by saying Dostoevsky), and be entertained. The beginning was kind of rough, reminiscent of 
					Suicide Squad jumping from one character intro to another barely giving any time to process each one. It works a little better here 
					though since we've already been introduced to Batman and Wonder Woman in prior films and are already familiar with the others. There's 
					just enough setup to develop each character. Once they unite the movie picks up and there's good chemistry amongst the team. Some of the most entertaining 
					parts are when they're taking verbal jabs at each other. There are no surprises but it was still worth the price of admission. A nice 
					bonus for folks that grew up watching the DC cartoons is a sense of nostalgia. Oh and of course stay through to the end of the credits.

					<p class = "post-text">Audition is a strange movie. It start off semi harmless a guy's son tells him he looks old and he 
					should remarry. Following his son's advice the man and his friend hold a fake movie audition that's really a front for him
					to interview a potential new wife. Sounds like the plot of an 80's rom com but this is more of an experimental or gore flick. 
					The hard cuts and vast tonal shifts throughout the movie might aggravate some but it added to the unease and tension. Despite 
					the third act being hard to follow, this is where it gets experimental, Audition was overall entertaining and if you're the kind 
					of person that laughs at scary movies you'll get some giggles in as well.

					<p class = "post-text">When I saw the trailer for The Foreigner I thought it was going to be 2 hours
					of Jackie Chan beating the crap out of people. In reality the film isn't really about Jackie going on
					a rampage while looking for answers. Its really about Pierce Brosnan a 'former' IRA member turned politician
					trying to make political moves while this rightfully so, madman Jackie looms over him. The plot wasn't too
					convoluted like political dramas tend to be. It was pretty cool to see Jackie fighting a bit dirty, smashing people
					through tables and cracking bottles over heads. The film was very chatty though and after the conflict was resolved
					it dragged for a bit. I'd suggest catching this one on tv if you like. But if you were looking for pure action
					you're better of watching a montage of the fights on YouTube.
